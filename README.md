# Space-Engineers
A description of the awesome space sandbox game for anyone who has never heard of it.

Space Engineers is a space sandbox game with an emphasis on physics. This game is an early access game on Steam, that is growing a fairly large fan base. It is always being updated(I believe every Thursday) and the community around it has built millions of designs and scripts and such to improve gameplay. That being said, it does have it's flaws. Seeing as it is still in developement, it is almost guranteed to have some occasional bugs or glitches. However, the community of players expects this, and gladly reports any bugs they come across so they may be fixed as quickly as possible. I highly encourage anyone and everyone to check this game out!
